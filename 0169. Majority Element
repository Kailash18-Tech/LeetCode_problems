             0169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

SOURCE CODE:

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {   //Majority is greater than half i.e [n/2]
        Arrays.sort(nums);         //After the array is sorted the majority is in the middle
        int n = nums.length;
        return nums[n/2];
    }
}

 OUTPUT:

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
